Duhhhh


<script type="text/javascript">
window.onload = function() {

	//	We did it in a window.onload event, but you can do it anywhere (requireJS load, anonymous function, jQuery dom ready, - whatever floats your boat)
	var game = new Phaser.Game(560, 560, Phaser.AUTO, 'game-container');
	
	//	Add the States your game has.
	//	You don't have to do this in the html, it could be done in your Boot state too, but for simplicity I'll keep it here.
	game.state.add('menu', basicGame.menuState);
	game.state.add('inside', basicGame.inState);
	game.state.add('outside', basicGame.outState);
	//	Now start the Boot state.
	game.state.start('menu');
